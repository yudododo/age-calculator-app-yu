## Overview👀

Hello visitors, I created this github repo to help me practice and showcase my not so refined html, css and JS skill.
Hope that you get a grasp of my current front end skills and help me improve what I lack by sending feedbacks.🙏🙏🙏<br>

## Layout🌼

<div style="display: flex; justify-content:center;">
  <img src="images/layout.png" style="width: 40%;">
</div>

## Screenshot🐻💥

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items:center;">
  <img src="./images/screenshot_desktop_01.png" style="width: 70%; margin-top: 20px; ">
  <img src="./images/screenshot_desktop_02.png" style="width: 70%; margin-top: 20px;" >
  <img src="./images/screenshot_desktop_03.png" style="width: 70%; margin-top: 20px;" >

<div style="display: flex; justify-content:center;" >

## The challenge🔥

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The date is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
